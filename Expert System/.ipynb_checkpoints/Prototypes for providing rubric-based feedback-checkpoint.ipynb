      "#networks 2 for the first reading (Winners Don't Punish), because the experimental design focuses on direct reciprocity, which deals with pairwise agents only. However, each node in the network can have more than one connection, so extending the experimental design to indirect reciprocity-- one that deals with the bigger picture of the network-- will improve the HC score on #network for this study\n",
      "4 in #networks. The Ohtsuki paper introduces the effects of indirect reciprocity which speaks to the secondary effects that cooperation might have in a network and how that could affect fitness of individuals and evolutions of species in general\n",
      "I think both #utility and #motivation are key to understanding #networks, as we saw in talking about why the crisis escalated. The government regulators were motivated by the want to preserve the status quo of growth, and this had primary effects of allowing the investors to continue selling bad CDOs, then secondary and tertiary effects leading to the crisis. The agents were all interconnected.\n",
      "When Zili was addressing the point of what are some of the motivations of different group that led to the financial meltdown and he mentioned how each group had hidden agenda to pass on the risk to the next group and that each group of people was interacting with another to facilitate the achieval of their utilities leading to network effects\n",
      "After my point about investors with desire for low-risk investments, Antonio pointed out in the chat his vision of what actually caused low interest rates in US. I think this gives a lot of perspective on the way we can apple those HC to social systems. \n",
      "When Kimberley conducted the panel about the importance of #emotionaliq, understanding how a network of agents that do not only interact rationally, but also emotionally may affect the indiviual #utility of an action by displacing its focus to a collective level of analysis, reconsidering the hidden #motivation behind one's action.\n",
      "For me persomally that moment was during the activity in which we were determining the agents and their motivation during the financial cricis. To do that, we had to analyse #utility and #motivation of each, which would also help to highlight the main agents and their effect on the rest of them, in addition, applying #emotionaliq would help in analysing the relationships between the agents\n",
      "When we discuss the motives and emotion-based actions of individual agents that contributed to the financial crisis, I understood how difficult it was to break the feedback loop: all agents acted rationally, yet their actions led directly to the collapse of the economy in the long run. Thus we must restructure society so that the invisible hand naturally guides economies in the best direction.\n",
      "One positive outcome is that we started to realize the global financial system is more interconnected than we thought before ( a small crisis in 2007 led to a world-wide economic conflagration by late 2008 and early 2009). The second positiove outcome is the central bank and government started to take some actions (The Bank Stress Tests to provide more information,FSOC to address systemic risk).\n",
      "this crisis made it clear how globally interconnected the economy is nowadays. It layed out all of the previously invisible relations, due to network effects. This is a con because misusing the economy in the US eg through subprime mortgage loans led Greece almost to a bankruptcy, however it is also a pro because it led to awareness of how to protect your market or use those networks to benefit\n"
